# ELE452 Final Prework

This repository contains the final prework assignments for the ELE452 Biomedical Imaging Systems course. It includes Python implementations of various medical imaging concepts, such as:

- Spatial frequency response and Noise Equivalent Bandwidth (Ne)
- X-ray attenuation and Hounsfield unit conversions
- PET imaging and radioactive decay simulation
- MRI relaxation (T1, T2) visualization
- Ultrasound pulse repetition period calculation
- Compton scattering energy ratio plotting
